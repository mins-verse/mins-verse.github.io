In the age of globalization and advanced technology, it is crucial to train future engineers, equip them with the necessary skills, and cultivate a mindset suited for an increasingly technological and globalized workplace is becoming a worldwide challenge for organizations. To ingratiate the need for such a working environment in the context of an increasingly becoming hybrid workplace, STEM education needs to not only help engineers develop knowledge and skills to overcome the distance and cultural restraints for global team collaboration but also engage them to the international collaboration experiences in a hands-on experiential learning environment.

This mixed reality (MR) simulation is designed to develop engineering technical skills as well as practice team collaboration skills. The simulation is composed of an introduction, a training, and a simulation section. The introduction section serves as an orientation for the team to get familiar with the MR environment by practicing necessary MR hand gestures and interaction functions. Upon successful completion of this part, participants move to work together to assemble a technical machine model. Instructions to assemble the model are provided in the training section including video, animated 3D models, and text explanations of the machine parts. When the model assembly is completed, collaborative work is required to run the machine built as part of the simulation. The validation section enables team members to engage in hands-on collaborative assembly activities without system instructions.
