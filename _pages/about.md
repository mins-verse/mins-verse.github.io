I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue University. I work under the advisement of Dr. Christos Mousas and belong to the Virtual Reality Lab. I hold Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science from Hongik University, South Korea. 

My research interests include extended reality, virtual human, human-computer interaction, procedural content generation, and animation. Mainly, I focus on how people interact with virtual humans regarding perceived intelligence. Also, I am interested in motion retargeting from video to 3D animation. 

If you have any questions, please send the email to choi714@purdue.edu.
