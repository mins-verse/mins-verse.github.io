I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue University. I work under the advice of Dr. Christos Mousas and I am also a research assistant at the Virtual Reality Lab. I hold Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science from Hongik University, South Korea. My research interests include extended reality, virtual humans, human-computer interaction, procedural content generation, and computer animation. In my Ph.D., I focus on how people interact with virtual humans during collaborative tasks and how they perceive their intelligence. Also, I am interested in motion retargeting from video to 3D animation. I have received the Best Paper Award <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> from ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (2023). If you have any questions, please send an email to choi714@purdue.edu.
