I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Oklahoma State University. My research centers on extended reality, intelligent agents, human-computer interaction, computer game design, and character animation. My research on human-computer interaction involves intelligent virtual characters collaborating with humans in tasks such as solving puzzles and examining character attributes, including behavior, personality, and appearance, to understand their influence on user experience. This work has been published in journals, including ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems and ACM Transactions on Applied Perception, and presented at leading conferences, such as ACM SIGGRAPH Motion, Interaction, and Games. I hold a Ph.D. from Purdue University in the Department of Computer Graphics Technology, a M.S. and a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from Hongik University, South Korea. I have received the Best Paper Award <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> from ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (2023). Outside of the office, I enjoy working out at the gym. <!--<span class="osu-highlight"> Now I am looking for Ph.D. students who are interested in extended reality, human-agent interaction and computer games. Please reach out to me.</span>-->
